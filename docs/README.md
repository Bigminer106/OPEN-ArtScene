*OPEN/ArtScene* presents users with a calendar-driven table / map interface showing **what** is happening in the *real* art world, **when**. A curated list of the city's best galleries populate the site with their Facebook events. If a gallery has an event on a given day, the gallery appears in a table for that day's events, and below as a location on the map. Users will be able to access a list of all *OPEN*'s chosen galleries, with all upcoming events on another page.

*OPEN* is a reference to gallery openings, the main kind of event the site will feature, but more importantly, describes the project's mission: *to open the doors of the art world to all*.

Denver is the pilot city for a model that could be implemented anywhere with someone willing to author the list of galleries to include.



*OPEN* includes:
* FB login for authentication
* Primary table interface
* Map interface
* List of active content (institutions, events)
* About / contact page (explaining mission, invitation to suggest new additions)
